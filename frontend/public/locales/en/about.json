      "description": "I am a Computer Science student with a solid background in Agronomy and Entomology, focusing on ecotoxicology and biological control. I am transitioning into IT with an emphasis on data analysis and software development. My work bridges scientific research with technology, using languages like C, C++, Java, Python, and Kotlin, and frameworks such as React, React Native, and Node.js. I seek internship opportunities where I can apply these skills in both local and international settings."
